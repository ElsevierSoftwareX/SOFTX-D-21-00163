# Software Name

This software, written in MATLAB, provides a fast, direct comparison of a 1-D general finite volume solution to the 1+1 shallow water equations (SWE) with a robust 1-D analytical solution presented by Nicolsky et al.

### Installation

Software may be download from GitHub via this [link](https://github.com/twbf/swe_runup). To run this software, it is ncessary to download [chebfun](https://www.chebfun.org/download/) and add it to path. 

### Usage

All simulations are produced by running `run.m` in the base file. Additionally, all adjustable parameters are located in `run.m`. These include initial conditions, simulation resolution, and plot outputs.

### More information
