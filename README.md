# Software Name

This software provides a fast, direct comparison of a 1-D general finite volume solution to the 1+1 shallow water equations (SWE) with a 1-D analytical solution presented by Nicolsky et al.

### Installation

Download [here](https://github.com/twbf/swe_runup).
Unzip `swe_runup` and add folder to your matlab path via. Executing the `run.m` file will automatically add all subfolders to path.

### Usage

All simulations are produced by running `run.m`. Additionally, all adjustable parameters are located in `run.m`. These include initial conditions, simulation resolution, and plot outputs.

### More information

For a full description of the functionalities of this software, see the attached paper.
